An application of athletic training, structured and provided by a semantic and frontend web application. This project is concerned with high-performance delivery of assets, clean CSS architecture and cross-browsing accessibility.

Technical Stack
* Frontend Web: HTML5 (Semantic Markup), CSS3 (Modular Stylesheets)
* Assets: Raster and vector graphics are optimised to perform well in the web.

Architectural Features
* Semantic HTML5 Architecture: It used a logical document outline (`<header>`), to guarantee high SEO ranking and accessibility of the document by the screen-readers.
* Modular CSS Pattern: This was accomplished by implementing a centralized style.css in order to support a single visual hierarchy on sub-pages (Shooting, Dribbling, Passing) to achieve the principles of OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS).
* Asset Pipeline: Developed a system to organize the file path of images and icons (e.g. stadium-icon.png, pitch-icon.png) to reduce the number of HTTP requests and loading time.
